# X-Pack-spring-security-realm
A custom realm for X-Pack which uses third party authentication and authorization system based on spring-security-oauth.

The integration of third party authentication and authorization system via custom realm support in X-Pack is well documented at 
[Custom Realm Support](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/custom-realms.html/)

This project takes most of the inspiration from the custom-realm example provided by the elastic community itself at [Custom Realm Sample](https://github.com/elastic/shield-custom-realm-example/)
